# Real PDF corpus test — 2026-08-23

Migrated from `isomorphisms/harvest-images-from-pdf`, branch `rwh-binary-parser`.

This records raw-byte corpus checks against four actual PDFs from the working file library. These checks are an oracle for parser tests: they exercise PDF header, whitespace/comment, decimal-integer, and indirect-object-header rules and independently inspect the next structures to parse.

This is **not** a claim that the project compiler executed successfully on this date. The local runtime did not have the compiler installed, and automated workflow writes did not produce an Actions run. The corpus checks below did run against the actual PDF bytes.

## Files

| file | bytes | SHA-256 | PDF version | first indirect object | first object byte offset | indirect-object headers found | final `startxref` target | xref form |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `GrAmHCScamManuscript.pdf` | 6,769,003 | `d9ad01512271038eff2c2748208cd4e3eee5423c4d2e79b2d7eda1f4f953bb27` | 1.3 | `1 0 obj` | 16 | 1,641 | 6,759,321 | classic `xref` table |

| `making_matrices_better.pdf` | 4,584,128 | `64d8ec829fcff266937138914aac942f35f7c579c7000a92869e284eda68488a` | 1.4 | `4 0 obj` | 15 | 507 | 4,573,805 | classic `xref` table |

All four:

- start with a header accepted by the parser rule;
- have a real indirect-object header within the first 16 bytes, so an 8 KiB prefix integration test is ample for these samples;
- end with `%%EOF` after their final `startxref` section;
- have a final `startxref` value that points to a classic `xref` table.

A reference implementation of the object-header byte rules was applied to every structurally recognized indirect-object header above. It agreed on object number and generation number for all 8,001 headers; there were zero mismatches.

## Bug found by the corpus

The first scanner attempted an indirect-object-header parse at every suffix. Because that parser deliberately accepts leading PDF whitespace and comments, a scan starting at byte 0 could skip `%PDF-...` and then parse the later first object while incorrectly reporting its position as byte 0.

The scanner should attempt an object-header parse only when the current raw byte is an ASCII digit. On these files it then reports the actual first-object offsets: 15 or 16.

## Image-object observations

These counts use dictionary-level `/Subtype /Image` markers associated with the nearest enclosing indirect object. They are useful corpus expectations, not parser output.

| file | image markers | `/Length` direct | `/Length` indirect reference | observed filters |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `GrAmHCScamManuscript.pdf` | 57 | 57 | 0 | 25 `/DCTDecode`, 32 `/FlateDecode` |
| `Hegel Myths and Legends … .pdf` | 1,194 | 1,194 | 0 | 799 `/JPXDecode`, 395 `/JBIG2Decode` |
| `fourier.pdf` | 0 | 0 | 0 | — |
| `making_matrices_better.pdf` | 50 | 0 | 50 | 50 `/FlateDecode` |

The important parser consequence is immediate: **`/Length` cannot be modeled as only a direct integer.** In `making_matrices_better.pdf`, every observed image stream uses an indirect length such as `/Length 21 0 R`. Image-stream extraction therefore needs to resolve an indirect reference before it knows how many bytes to consume.

Other image metadata also varies. The Hegel scan uses both JPX and JBIG2 image compression; its JBIG2 image dictionaries do not necessarily carry the same `/ColorSpace` and `/BitsPerComponent` entries as the JPX images. Preserve dictionary metadata rather than assuming one fixed image schema.

## Next corpus test

After `startxref`, dictionaries, indirect references, and streams are implemented, these four files are suitable for regression checks that:

1. resolve the final cross-reference table;
2. seek to a known indirect object by byte offset;
3. identify image stream dictionaries structurally;
4. resolve both direct and indirect `/Length` values;
5. consume exactly the declared stream bytes;
6. report image filter and basic geometry metadata without scanning inside opaque stream data.
