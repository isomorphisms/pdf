# PDF data and object types

Migrated from `isomorphisms/harvest-images-from-pdf`, branch `figure-caption-association`.

This is the parser-facing inventory of PDF value types. It follows ISO 32000-2:2020 terminology with current resolved errata and keeps three different ideas separate:

1. the basic object types that actually occur in PDF syntax;
2. indirect-object/reference syntax, which changes how an object is stored or named but does not create a new underlying value type;
3. common semantic data types defined by the PDF standard in terms of the basic object types.

This separation should be preserved when the model is encoded.

## 1. Basic PDF object types

At the object-syntax level, a PDF parser needs to represent these nine basic types.

### Boolean

Manual: ISO 32000-2:2020 §7.3.2.

Syntax:

```pdf
true
false
```

Two values only.

### Integer

Manual: ISO 32000-2:2020 §7.3.3.

Examples:

```pdf
0
17
-42
+3
```

An integer numeric object.

### Real

Manual: ISO 32000-2:2020 §7.3.3.

Examples:

```pdf
3.14
-0.25
.5
12.
```

A non-integer numeric object. The standard also uses the broader term **number** for either an integer or a real.

### String

Manual: ISO 32000-2:2020 §7.3.4.

A sequence of bytes. It has two lexical representations, but these are two encodings of the same basic PDF object type.

Literal string:

```pdf
(hello)
```

Hexadecimal string:

```pdf
<68656C6C6F>
```

Strings may later be given a semantic subtype such as text string, ASCII string, byte string, or PDFDocEncoded string.

### Name

Manual: ISO 32000-2:2020 §7.3.5.

Examples:

```pdf
/Type
/Image
/FlateDecode
```

A name is an atomic identifier represented by a leading `/`. `#xx` hexadecimal escapes may occur inside a name.

### Array

Manual: ISO 32000-2:2020 §7.3.6.

Example:

```pdf
[1 2 3 /Image null]
```

An ordered sequence of PDF objects. Elements may have different types.

### Dictionary

Manual: ISO 32000-2:2020 §7.3.7.

Example:

```pdf
<<
  /Type /XObject
  /Subtype /Image
  /Width 640
  /Height 480
>>
```

A mapping from **name objects** to PDF objects. Dictionary values may be of any PDF object type allowed by the surrounding specification.

### Stream

Manual: ISO 32000-2:2020 §7.3.8.

Example shape:

```pdf
<< /Length 123 >>
stream
...123 bytes...
endstream
```

A stream consists of a stream dictionary plus a byte sequence. The bytes may be compressed, encrypted, image data, page-description instructions, font data, metadata, or essentially any other stream payload permitted by the surrounding PDF object definition.

For parsing, the important rule is that the stream body is binary data. Once `/Length` is known, consume the stream extent as bytes rather than searching inside it for PDF-looking keywords.

### Null

Manual: ISO 32000-2:2020 §7.3.9.

Syntax:

```pdf
null
```

The distinguished null object.

## 2. Numeric supertype

Manual: ISO 32000-2:2020 §7.3.3 and Table 35 row `number`.

The specification commonly says **number** when either of these is accepted:

```text
number = integer | real
```

`number` is useful in a typed model as a choice or constraint, but it is not a tenth primitive serialized form.

## 3. Direct objects, indirect objects, and references

Manual: ISO 32000-2:2020 §7.3.10 for indirect objects and references.

These are structurally important to a parser, but they are not additional basic value types.

### Direct object

A value written directly where it is used:

```pdf
/Width 640
```

Here `640` is a direct integer object.

### Indirect object

A PDF object assigned an object number and generation number:

```pdf
12 0 obj
<< /Type /XObject /Subtype /Image >>
endobj
```

The wrapped value is still a dictionary, array, string, stream, etc.

### Indirect reference

A reference to an indirect object:

```pdf
12 0 R
```

This should have its own parser/AST constructor because it occurs in object syntax, even though the referenced object's eventual value has one of the basic types above.

A useful typed distinction is roughly:

```text
PDF value
  = null
  | boolean
  | integer
  | real
  | string
  | name
  | array of PDF values/references
  | dictionary from names to PDF values/references
  | stream
  | indirect reference
```

with `indirect object` represented separately as storage/identity metadata around a value.

## 4. Common PDF data types defined by the standard

Source for the names in this section: **ISO 32000-2:2020 §7.9.1, Table 35 — “PDF data types” (informative)**, with the resolved errata current on 2026-08-23.

Table 35 contains 20 type names. Most are semantic refinements or standardized structures built from the basic object types rather than new primitive syntax.

### ASCII string
Underlying type: **string**.

### Array
Underlying type: **array**.

### Boolean
Underlying type: **boolean**.

### Byte string
Underlying type: **string**.

### Date
Underlying type: **string**.

### Dictionary
Underlying type: **dictionary**.

### File specification
Underlying type: **string or dictionary**.

### Function
Underlying type: **dictionary or stream**.

### Integer
Underlying type: **integer**.

### Name
Underlying type: **name**.

### Name tree
Underlying type: **dictionary structure**.

### Null
Underlying type: **null**.

### Number
Underlying type: **integer or real**.

### Number tree
Underlying type: **dictionary structure**.

### PDFDocEncoded string
Underlying type: **text string**, hence ultimately **string**.

### Rectangle
Underlying type: **array** of exactly four numeric elements:

```pdf
[x1 y1 x2 y2]
```

### Stream
Underlying type: **stream**.

### String
Underlying type: **string**.

### Text string
Underlying type: **string**.

### Text stream
Underlying type: **stream**.

## 5. Lexical forms that are not distinct data types

Do not accidentally multiply the type system merely because PDF has multiple textual spellings.

- `(literal string)` and `<hexadecimal string>` are both **string objects**.
- `17`, `+17`, and `00017` are all **integer objects** if accepted by the relevant syntax rules.
- `/Name` and a name containing `#xx` escapes are both **name objects**.
- `<< ... >> stream ... endstream` is one **stream object** whose dictionary is part of that stream object.
- `12 0 obj ... endobj` gives identity/storage to an object; it does not change the wrapped object's type.

## 6. Semantic PDF objects are generally not new data types

PDF defines hundreds of named object kinds: page dictionaries, catalog dictionaries, font dictionaries, annotations, XObjects, image XObjects, form XObjects, cross-reference streams, object streams, ICC profiles, actions, destinations, structure elements, and so on.

Those are schemas or semantic roles built from the object types above. For example:

```text
image XObject          = stream with an image-XObject dictionary
page                   = dictionary with the page schema
font                   = usually dictionary plus related objects/streams
cross-reference stream = stream with the xref-stream schema
object stream          = stream with the object-stream schema
```

For this project that distinction is especially useful: `/Subtype /Image` does not introduce an `Image` primitive. It tells us that a particular **stream object** follows the image-XObject schema and that its stream bytes should be interpreted according to entries such as `/Filter`, `/Width`, `/Height`, `/ColorSpace`, and `/BitsPerComponent`.

## 7. Parser checklist

A complete low-level object parser should eventually recognize:

```text
null
boolean
integer
real
string: literal form
string: hexadecimal form
name
array
dictionary
stream
indirect reference
indirect-object wrapper
```

After that, semantic validation can refine generic values into things such as rectangle, text string, image XObject, page, or cross-reference stream without making the byte-level parser responsible for the entire PDF specification.

The important implementation distinction is intentional: the **basic parser types** are a small closed set; the hundreds of named PDF object kinds belong in later schema/semantic layers.
